NAME
     wc - display a count of lines, words  and  characters  in  a
     file

SYNOPSIS
     wc  [-c  | -m  | -C ]  [ -lw ]  [ _f_i_l_e ... ]

DESCRIPTION
     The wc  utility reads  one  or  more  input  files  and,  by
     default,  writes the number of newline characters, words and
     bytes contained in each input file to the standard output.

     The utility also writes a total count for all  named  files,
     if more than one input file is specified.

     wc  considers a _w_o_r_d to be a non-zero-length string of char-
     acters  delimited by white space (for example, SPACE, TAB ).
     See iswspace(3C) or isspace(3C).

OPTIONS
     The following options are supported:

     -c        Count bytes.

     -m        Count characters.

     -C        Same as -m.

     -l        Count lines.

     -w        Count words delimited by white space characters or
               new  line  characters.  Delimiting  characters are
               Extended Unix Code (EUC) characters from any  code
               set defined by iswspace().

     If no option is specified the default is -lwc (count  lines,
     words, and bytes.)

OPERANDS
     The following operand is supported:

     _f_i_l_e      A path name of an input file. If no _f_i_l_e  operands
               are specified, the standard input will be used.

USAGE
     See largefile(5) for the description of the behavior  of  wc
     when encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte ( 2
    **31 bytes).

     variables  that  affect  the  execution  of  wc  : LC_CTYPE,
