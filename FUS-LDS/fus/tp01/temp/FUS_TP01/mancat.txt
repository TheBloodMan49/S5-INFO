NAME
     cat - concatenate and display files

SYNOPSIS
     cat  [ -nbsuvet ]  [ _f_i_l_e ... ]

DESCRIPTION
     cat  reads each _f_i_l_e in sequence and writes it on the  stan-
     dard output. Thus:

     example% cat file
     prints _f_i_l_e on your terminal, and:

     example% cat file1 file2 >file3
     concatenates _f_i_l_e_1 and _f_i_l_e_2,  and  writes  the  results  in
     _f_i_l_e_3.  If no input file is given, cat  reads from the stan-
     dard input file.

OPTIONS
     -n        Precede each line output with its line number.

     -b        Number the lines, as -n, but omit the line numbers
               from blank lines.

     -u        The output is not buffered. (The default  is  buf-
               fered output.)

     -s        cat  is silent about non-existent files.

     -v        Non-printing characters  (with  the  exception  of
               tabs,  new-lines and form-feeds) are printed visi-
               bly. ASCII control characters (octal  000  -  037)
               are  printed  as  ^_n, where _n is the corresponding
               ASCII character in the range octal 100 -  137  (@,
               A,  B,  C, . . ., X, Y, Z, [, \, ], ^, and _); the
               DEL character (octal 0177) is  printed  ^?.  Other
               non-printable characters are printed as M-_x, where
               _x is the ASCII character  specified  by  the  low-
               order seven bits.

     When used with the -v option, the following options  may  be
     used:

     -e        A $ character will be printed at the end  of  each
               line (prior to the new-line).

     -t        Tabs will be printed as ^I's and formfeeds  to  be
               printed as ^L's.

     The -e and -t options are ignored if the -v  option  is  not
     specified.

User Commands                                              cat(1)



OPERANDS
     The following operand is supported:

     file      A path name of an input file. If no _f_i_l_e is speci-
               fied,  the standard input is used. If _f_i_l_e is `-',
               cat  will read from the  standard  input  at  that
               point  in  the  sequence.  cat  will not close and
               reopen standard input when  it  is  referenced  in
               this  way, but will accept multiple occurrences of
               `-' as _f_i_l_e.

USAGE
     See largefile(5) for the description of the behavior of  cat
     when encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte ( 2
    **31 bytes).

EXAMPLES
     Example 1: Concatenate a file.

     The following command:

     example% cat myfile
     writes the contents of the file _m_y_f_i_l_e to standard output.

     Example 2: Concatenate two files into one.

     The following command:

     example% cat doc1 doc2 > doc.all
     concatenates the files _d_o_c_1 and _d_o_c_2 and writes  the  result
     to _d_o_c._a_l_l.

     Example 3: Concatinate two arbitrary pieces of input with  a
     single invocation.

     The command:

     example% cat start - middle - end > file
     when standard input is a terminal, gets two arbitrary pieces
     of input from the terminal with a single invocation of cat .
     Note, however, that if standard input  is  a  regular  file,
     this would be equivalent to the command:

     cat start - middle /dev/null end > file
     because the entire contents of the file would be consumed by
     cat   the  first  time `-' was used as a _f_i_l_e operand and an
     end-of-file condition would be detected immediately when `-'
     was referenced the second time.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
     See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment
     variables  that  affect  the  execution  of  cat : LC_CTYPE,

     LC_MESSAGES,  and NLSPATH.

EXIT STATUS
     The following exit values are returned:

     0         All input files were output successfully.

     >0        An error occurred.

ATTRIBUTES
     See attributes(5) for descriptions of the  following  attri-
     butes:
     ____________________________________________________________
    |       ATTRIBUTE TYPE        |       ATTRIBUTE VALUE       |

NOTES
     Redirecting the output of cat  onto one of the  files  being
     read  will cause the loss of the data originally in the file
     being read. For example,

     example% cat filename1 filename2 >filename1
     causes the original data in _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e_1 to be lost.
